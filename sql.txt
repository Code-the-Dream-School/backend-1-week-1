This is a naming convention example on how your PR name should look like.
Please put your First & Last name in your PR title so the mentors can tell who's PR is it.
Thank you and much appreciated! Cheers!

Step by step:
  1) After edit & save your remote repo, open your terminal/shell and cd to your directory.
     ex.==> Macbooks-MacBook-Pro:Backend-sqlintro macbook$
  2) After the $ sign, type in:

      git add -A

     ex.==> Macbooks-MacBook-Pro:Backend-sqlintro macbook$ git add -A
  3) Notice the sql.txt file in your left panel is grey out or become the same color as the other files.
     (depends on what IDE you are using, color might be different), but the terminal doesn't not show any new line.
  4) Just type in:  (make sure you have typed 'git add -A' and hit enter before this step)

      git commit "Jasper_Lin(replace this with your first & last name) assignment week_1."

  5) After you hit enter, It'll show several lines of info about your git config and number of files changed.
     (something like this in the last few lines):
        .......
        1 file changed, 4 insertions(+), 14 deletions(-)
        rewrite sql.txt (100%)
  6) Do a 'git push' (it might ask you to set the origin if u had branch out from Master, then u can use the second command):
     After the $ sign, type in:

      git push

     If it says 'fatal: The current branch blah-blah-blah ...', try:

     git push --set-upstream origin JasperLin(replace this with your branch name)

  7) Go to GitHub and create a PR.
     (After push, login to https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/Backend-sqlintro ,
     and there should be a prompt dialog bar asking you to create a PR.
     Click on the bar and it should redirect you to to create PR page.)
